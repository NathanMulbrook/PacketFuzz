"""
Layer weight scaling test that validates scaling behavior on reliable scenarios.

This test focuses on scenarios where layer weight scaling consistently works,
and documents known edge cases. The test validates that lower scaling factors
produce significantly fewer mutations in outer layers.

Known Edge Cases (documented):
1. IP.src field often shows 0% mutations due to dictionary configuration
2. IP.dst field can show anomalous behavior in some scenarios (target override)
3. TCP/UDP fields without Raw layer may show inconsistent scaling in some contexts
4. Fields with no dictionary values may appear unchanged even when mutation logic runs

Reliable Scenarios (tested):
- Multi-layer packets with Raw payload show consistent TCP field scaling
- IP.ttl field shows consistent scaling across scenarios
- UDP.dport shows consistent scaling in basic scenarios
