## Running the Examples

### Sequential Learning (Recommended)
```bash
python3 examples/basic/01_quick_start.py
python3 examples/basic/02_campaign_types.py  
python3 examples/basic/03_pcap_basics.py
```

### Individual Examples
```bash
# Run specific example
python3 examples/basic/01_quick_start.py

# With verbose output
python3 examples/basic/02_campaign_types.py --verbose
```

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of network protocols (helpful but not required)
- Scapy library installed
- Network permissions for packet sending

## Key Concepts Covered

### Campaign Structure
- Inheriting from `FuzzingCampaign`
- Setting target addresses
- Defining packet templates
- Configuring iteration limits

### Packet Construction
- Basic Scapy packet building
- Layer composition (IP/TCP/UDP)
- Payload configuration
- Port and address specification

### Fuzzing Modes
- Dictionary-based fuzzing
- Field-specific targeting
- Rate limiting
- Response capture

### PCAP Integration
- Loading existing captures
- Regression testing
- Layer extraction
- Payload analysis

## Common Issues

### Permission Errors
Some examples require network permissions:
```bash
sudo python3 examples/basic/01_quick_start.py
```

### Target Unreachable
Examples use localhost by default. If issues occur:
- Check firewall settings
- Verify target addresses
- Use `--dry-run` for testing

### Missing Dependencies
Ensure all requirements are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Learning Path

1. **Start Here**: `01_quick_start.py`
   - Understand basic campaign structure
   - Learn essential concepts
   - Get familiar with output format

2. **Expand Knowledge**: `02_campaign_types.py`
   - Explore different protocols
   - Learn target specification
   - Understand rate limiting

3. **Advanced Techniques**: `03_pcap_basics.py`
   - PCAP file integration
   - Regression testing concepts
   - Layer-specific fuzzing

4. **Next Steps**: Move to `../advanced/` examples
   - Complex configurations
   - Callback systems
   - Advanced PCAP techniques

## Tips for Beginners

### Understanding Output
- `üì¶` indicates packet being sent
- `üì®` shows responses received
- `‚è∞` indicates timeouts
- `‚úÖ` shows successful operations

### Modifying Examples
- Change target addresses to your test environment
- Adjust iteration counts for testing
- Experiment with different packet types
- Try various rate limits

### Debugging
- Use `print()` statements to understand flow
- Check packet construction with `.show()`
- Verify target connectivity first
- Start with small iteration counts
