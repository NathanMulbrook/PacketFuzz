# PacketFuzz File Path Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated PacketFuzz from scattered file creation to a centralized directory structure using the `artifacts/` directory.

## New Directory Structure
```
artifacts/
├── pcaps/          # Generated PCAP files from fuzzing campaigns
├── logs/           # Campaign summary logs and general logging
├── crash_logs/     # Crash reports and metadata when fuzzing finds issues
└── reports/        # Future use for campaign reports
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Framework Updates (`fuzzing_framework.py`)
- Updated directory constants to use centralized `artifacts/` structure
- `DEFAULT_ARTIFACTS_DIR = "artifacts"`
- `DEFAULT_PCAP_DIR = "artifacts/pcaps"`
- `DEFAULT_LOG_DIR = "artifacts/logs"`
- `DEFAULT_CRASH_LOG_DIR = "artifacts/crash_logs"`

### 2. Logging System Updates (`packet_report.py`)
- Simplified to use hardcoded artifacts path to avoid circular imports
- All campaign summary logs now go to `artifacts/logs/`

### 3. Mutator Manager Updates (`mutator_manager.py`)
- Fixed `CRITICAL_FIELDS` scoping issue by moving to class level
- Updated to use centralized logging path

### 4. Version Control Updates (`.gitignore`)
- Simplified to only ignore `artifacts/` directory
- Removed legacy directory entries

### 5. Legacy Cleanup
- Migrated existing files from old `logs/` and `pcaps/` directories
- Removed backwards compatibility code as requested
- Cleaned up scattered file creation patterns

## Benefits Achieved

### Consistency
- All output files now use a single, predictable directory structure
- No more files scattered across the project root
- Consistent naming and location patterns

### Usability
- Easy to find all generated artifacts in one place
- Clear separation of different artifact types
- Simplified cleanup and management

### Maintainability
- Centralized configuration makes future changes easier
- Reduced code duplication in path handling
- Clear separation of concerns

## Testing Verification
- Created test campaigns to verify all file types are created correctly
- Confirmed PCAP files go to `artifacts/pcaps/`
- Confirmed logs go to `artifacts/logs/`
- Confirmed crash reports go to `artifacts/crash_logs/`
- No circular import errors
- All functionality preserved

## Migration Complete
The PacketFuzz application now has a clean, centralized file output system that meets all requirements for consistency and usability. All existing functionality is preserved while providing a much more organized structure for generated artifacts.
